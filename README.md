This [notebook](https://github.com/aryanmsr/professional_cricket_leagues_data/blob/main/Thesis_Twitter_Dataset_Clean.ipynb) contains the code used to extract Twitter data from 10 different cricket leagues' Twitter accounts using the Python snscrape library. The purpose of this notebook was to create a complete and clean dataset that would later be used to perform Econometric analysis on STATA for my thesis. I also performed some basic sentiment analysis using Textblob to obtain polarity and subjectivity scores from the relevant tweets.

It is important to point out that one should use this notebook solely as a reference to my original thesis paper: "Analysing the Impact of Social Media Marketing on User Engagement Using Natural Language Processing and Big Data Analytics: The Case of Professional Cricket Leagues". I have attached the abstract of my thesis below. If you want to read my full thesis, please go to this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12O0pSfLe5M7m73ix6uk5TLUgcQOVHulS/view?usp=sharing).

As always, any feedback, queries or concerns regarding this notebook are highly apprecaited. Feel free to email me at aryanmsr@gmail.com.

### Abstract

The rise of social media has transformed our lives in an unprecedented way.
Marketers today have embraced this phenomenon as a key marketing channel to
communicate with customers and spread their message across the world to a
massive potential audience. The sport of Cricket is no different. Social media has
transformed this sport in such a way that it has allowed several cricket leagues to
leverage social media as a platform to enhance user engagement and worldwide
fandom to even greater heights. The goal of this thesis is to dive in deeper into the
relationship between a cricket league’s social media marketing efforts and user
engagement by leveraging Big Data and Natural Language Processing techniques
from social media. In particular, this thesis applies the dual perspective of user
engagement and analyses the impact of the interaction, personalisation, and
sentiment dimensions of a cricket league’s social media marketing efforts on user
engagement. Big data was collected, transformed, and integrated from Twitter over a
40-month period between January 2018 and May 2021 using various technologies
such as Python, STATA, and Microsoft Excel to analyse over 50,000 tweets from the
top 10 cricket leagues in the world. Econometric analysis was then performed which
yielded the following results: Cricket leagues should focus on maximising interaction
and positive sentiments in order to significantly increase user engagement, while
focusing on personalisation actually leads to a decrease in user engagement. The
results from this thesis have important implications for marketers designing and
executing social media marketing strategies for cricket leagues to enhance user
engagement. These results are especially relevant for marketers of smaller, lesser-
known leagues, who may not have the budget or the resources available to analyse
and derive insights from social media data effectively.
