This notebook contains the code used to extract Twitter data from 10 different cricket leagues' Twitter accounts. The purpose of this notebook was to create a complete and clean dataset that would later be used to perform Econometric analysis on for my thesis. Therefore, one should use this notebook solely as a reference when reading my thesis paper: "Analysing the Impact of Social Media Marketing on User Engagement Using Natural Language Processing and Big Data Analytics: The Case of Professional Cricket Leagues".

If you have any feedback, queries or concerns regarding this notebook, please feel free to email me at aryanmsr@gmail.com.
